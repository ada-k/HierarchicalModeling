     The data are the responses of a sample of 150 individuals to 9
multiple-choice items from a General Certificate of Education O-level
mathematics paper containing 60 items in all. The responses are coded 1 for
correct answer and 0 for incorrect. The items appear to test ability in
two-dimensional Euclidean geometry. The data have one column with 1350 records
ordered by item within individuals. There are no missing data. The ML3
worksheet file STARTER.WS0 contains more named empty columns ready for use by
multilevel response models.
